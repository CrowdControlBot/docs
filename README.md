# What is CrowdControl?

CrowdControl is a server management and moderation bot for your Discord servers.



Below is a couple of use cases for CrowdControl's services

> A small server with a bunch of friends, looking for a bot to make their Discord server nice and _\*snazzy\*._
>
> — CrowdControl can handle that!

> A moderately large server wanting to revamp their server and provide powerful moderation and automoderation tools for their moderators.
>
> — CrowdControl can provide that also!

> A large server having to deal with constant rule breakers and bad actors. Also has ever changing channels, complex permissions setups and various other tasks they'd prefer automated.
>
> — You won't believe it, but CrowdControl can manage all of that too!

## Getting Started
