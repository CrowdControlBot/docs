# What is CrowdControl?

CrowdControl is a server management and moderation bot for your Discord servers.



Below is a couple of use cases for CrowdControl's services

> A small server with a bunch of friends, looking for a bot to make their Discord server nice and _\*snazzy\*._
>
> — CrowdControl can handle that!

> A moderately large server wanting to revamp their server and provide powerful moderation and automoderation tools for their moderators.
>
> — CrowdControl can provide that also!

> A large server having to deal with constant rule breakers and bad actors. Also has ever changing channels, complex permissions setups and various other tasks they'd prefer automated.
>
> — You won't believe it, but CrowdControl can manage all of that too!

## Getting Started

**Alright, this is the easy part! Simply invite the bot using the link below:**

****[**https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=882408970055217223\&permissions=8\&scope=bot%20applications.commands**](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=882408970055217223\&permissions=8\&scope=bot%20applications.commands)****

{% hint style="info" %}
**Good to know:** If you'd prefer the bot have no permissions on joining, set the permissions value to 0 in the invite URL!
{% endhint %}
